### CLOAK attack conceals adversarial textures visible only from certain views

![CLOAK Attack](docs/crown_jewel_cloak.png)

#### CLOAK is a poisoning attack method - benign images are replaced with adversarial images in the 3DGS training dataset for targeted camera viewpoints.

### DAGGER manipulates Gaussian attributes to induce misdetections on Faster R-CNN. 
![DAGGER Attack](docs/dagger_crown_jewel.png)

#### DAGGER generalizes projected gradient descent attack by exploiting the differentiability of the 3DGS scene representation to manipulate splat color, scaling, translation, rotation, or alpha attributes to fool object detectors.
